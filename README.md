# mini-7-segment-clock
upload of an old project i made a couple of years ago. 

there are a couple of pictures of how the pcb files are connected to make a clock, and how the RTC is added. 

if you have any questions plzz ask and i will try to answer them. 

it is called mini because it is a mini version of another 7 segment clock i have made years before this one was made.
